# Chapter 1: The First Major Challenge: The Revolt of 1857

#### Background and Initiation of the Revolt
- **Date and Initial Incident**: The revolt began on May 11, 1857, when Sepoys from Meerut killed their European officers, crossed the Jamuna River, and entered Delhi, appealing to Bahadur Shah II to lead them.
- **Bahadur Shah II's Role**: Initially reluctant, Bahadur Shah II was persuaded to support the rebels and was proclaimed Shahenshah-e-Hindustan, giving the revolt a symbolic political legitimacy.

#### Spread and Key Locations
- **Meerut to Delhi**: The revolt in Meerut and the capture of Delhi triggered widespread mutinies across North, Central, and Western India.
- **Key Regions**: Significant rebel activities were noted in Kanpur, Lucknow, Benares, Allahabad, Bareilly, Jagdishpur, and Jhansi. South India remained largely unaffected.

#### Leaders of the Revolt
- **Nana Saheb**: Led the revolt in Kanpur, the adopted son of the last Peshwa.
- **Begum Hazrat Mahal**: Led in Lucknow, her son Birjis Qadir was proclaimed Nawab.

- **Kunwar Singh**: Led in Bihar, a zamindar of Jagdishpur, joined the revolt despite his old age.
- **Rani Lakshmibai**: The most notable leader, led the revolt in Jhansi after her state was annexed by the British.

#### Reasons for the Revolt
- **Religious Grievances**: The introduction of the Enfield Rifle, requiring sepoys to bite cartridges rumored to be greased with beef and pig fat, inflamed religious sensibilities.
- **Economic Hardships**: Sepoys were unhappy with their low pay and harsh conditions compared to British soldiers.
- **Racial Discrimination**: Sepoys faced discrimination and lack of promotion opportunities.
- **Cultural and Social Issues**: Fear of religious conversion and loss of caste due to overseas service also contributed.

#### Nature of the Revolt
- **Mass Uprising**: The revolt was not limited to sepoys but included a large-scale civil rebellion, particularly in the North Western Provinces and Oudh.
- **Agrarian Distress**: Excessive taxation and land revenue systems impoverished peasants, leading to widespread discontent.
- **Dispossession of Aristocracy**: Traditional landed aristocracy and feudal chiefs, who lost power and privileges under British rule, joined the revolt.



#### British Response and Aftermath
- **Military Response**: British forces recaptured key cities and defeated rebel leaders one by one.
- **Key Battles**: Delhi fell on September 20, 1857, and other centers were subdued subsequently. Rani Lakshmibai died in battle, Nana Saheb escaped to Nepal, and Tantia Tope was eventually captured and executed.
- **Impact**: The revolt, despite its failure, marked a significant challenge to British rule and laid the groundwork for future nationalistic movements.

### Important Concepts and Themes

# Chapter 2: Civil Rebellions and Tribal Uprisings

#### Overview
- **Century-long Resistance**: The Revolt of 1857 was the most dramatic, but not the only instance of resistance to British rule. Various forms of resistance, including civil rebellions, tribal uprisings, and peasant movements, occurred throughout the first 100 years of British rule.
- **Major Forms of Resistance**: Civil rebellions and tribal uprisings were significant forms of resistance. Peasant movements were also prevalent.

#### Causes of Civil Rebellions
- **Economic Disruptions**: Rapid changes introduced by the British in the economy, administration, and land revenue systems disrupted the agrarian society, leading to widespread suffering.
- **Increased Land Revenue**: The colonial policy of maximizing land revenue caused significant upheaval in Indian villages. For example, land revenue collection in Bengal nearly doubled within 30 years under British rule.
- **Loss of Land**: Thousands of zamindars and poligars lost control over their land and revenue due to extinction of their rights or forced sales.
- **Peasant Hardships**: Increased land revenue demands forced many peasants into debt or landlessness, leading to higher rents and evictions by new landlords.
- **Legal System and Corruption**: The new courts and legal system favored the dispossessors of land and encouraged oppression of the poor. Corruption among lower-level officials was rampant.
- **Artisan Decline**: The ruin of Indian handicraft industries due to British policies impoverished millions of artisans.
- **Cultural and Religious Oppression**: The British disrupted traditional patronage systems, affecting scholars, religious preachers, and artists.

#### Key Civil Rebellions
- **Eastern India**: Significant uprisings included the Sanyasi Rebellion (1763-1800), Chuar Uprising (1766-1772, 1795-1816), and revolts in Rangpur, Dinajpur, Bishnupur, Birbhum, Orissa, and Sambalpur.
- **Southern India**: Major rebellions included those led by the Raja of Vizianagram (1794), poligars of Tamil Nadu, Malabar, coastal Andhra, and Velu Thampi of Travancore (1805).
- **Western India**: Uprisings included those by the chiefs of Saurashtra, Kolis of Gujarat, Bhil uprisings, Kittur uprising, Satara uprising, and the revolt of the Gadkaris.
- **Northern India**: Key rebellions included those in Western U.P., Haryana, Bilaspur, Aligarh, Bundelas of Jabalpur, and Khandesh.

#### Nature of Civil Rebellions
- **Localized and Isolated**: The rebellions were localized, arising from local grievances, and lacked coordination. They were traditional and backward-looking in their objectives.
- **British Suppression**: The British pacified rebel areas one by one, often giving concessions to less fiery rebel leaders while physically eliminating the more recalcitrant ones.
- **Legacy**: These rebellions established strong local traditions of resistance that later inspired the nationalist struggle for freedom.

#### Tribal Uprisings
- **Disruption of Tribal Life**: British colonial policies disrupted the traditional agrarian order of tribal communities, introducing new land revenue systems, taxation, and middlemen.
- **Oppression and Exploitation**: Tribal people faced oppression and extortion from policemen, revenue farmers, and other officials. They lost lands and were reduced to laborers and tenants.
- **Forest Policies**: The colonial government restricted access to forest products and lands, affecting tribal livelihoods.
- **Religious and Charismatic Leaders**: Many tribal uprisings were led by religious and charismatic leaders who promised divine intervention and an end to suffering.

#### Key Tribal Uprisings
### **Santhal Rebellion (1855-56)**: 
The Santhal Rebellion, also known as the Santhal Hool, was a significant uprising by the Santhal tribal community against British colonial authorities, oppressive landlords (zamindars), and moneylenders (mahajans) in the mid-19th century. It took place primarily in the Bengal Presidency, covering areas of modern-day Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. The rebellion, which lasted from 1855 to 1856, is remembered as one of the earliest and most notable resistances against British rule in India.

  **Background and Causes**

  The Santhals, an indigenous tribal community, had a distinct culture and way of life centered around agriculture and forest-based livelihoods. Before the rebellion, they faced severe exploitation and oppression from landlords, moneylenders, and British officials. The introduction of the Permanent Settlement by the British in 1793 led to the creation of a zamindari system, which heavily taxed the Santhals and disrupted their traditional landholding patterns.

  The landlords and moneylenders exploited the Santhals through unfair land practices and exorbitant interest rates on loans, leading to widespread indebtedness and loss of land. The British administration's policies exacerbated these issues, as they often sided with the landlords and moneylenders, further alienating the Santhals. This exploitation, coupled with economic hardships and loss of traditional livelihoods, led to growing discontent among the Santhal community.

  **Leadership and Organization**

  The rebellion was led by four brothers: Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand, and Bhairav Murmu. They emerged as prominent leaders who inspired and mobilized the Santhal community to rise against their oppressors. Sidhu and Kanhu, in particular, played a crucial role in organizing the rebellion, holding large gatherings and issuing proclamations of resistance against the British and their allies.

  On June 30, 1855, a significant gathering of Santhals took place at Bhognadih village, where the leaders declared their intention to overthrow the British and establish self-rule. This marked the official beginning of the Santhal Hool, as the Santhals vowed to fight against the injustices they faced.

  **The Uprising**

  The Santhal Rebellion quickly spread across the region, with thousands of Santhals joining the cause. They launched attacks on government establishments, zamindar estates, and police stations, disrupting British administration and striking fear into the hearts of their oppressors. The rebellion was characterized by its scale and intensity, as the Santhals used traditional weapons and guerrilla tactics to confront the colonial forces.

  The British were initially caught off guard by the uprising's magnitude and ferocity. However, they soon mobilized a large military force to suppress the rebellion. The British forces, equipped with modern weaponry and superior numbers, launched a brutal campaign to crush the resistance. Villages were burned, and many Santhals were killed or captured.

  **Suppression and Aftermath**

  By the end of 1856, the Santhal Rebellion was largely suppressed. The British forces managed to capture or kill many of the rebellion's leaders, including Sidhu and Kanhu. The uprising was brutally crushed, leaving a trail of devastation and loss in its wake. Thousands of Santhals lost their lives, and their communities were severely affected.

  Despite its suppression, the Santhal Rebellion had a lasting impact. It highlighted the exploitation and plight of tribal communities under British rule and brought attention to the need for administrative and land revenue reforms. In response, the British government created the Santhal Parganas district, a separate administrative unit for the Santhals, acknowledging their unique cultural identity and attempting to address some of their grievances.

  **Legacy**

  The Santhal Rebellion remains a significant event in the history of India's struggle against colonial rule. It is remembered as a symbol of resistance and resilience among tribal communities. The rebellion inspired future movements and highlighted the importance of addressing the socio-economic and cultural needs of indigenous populations. Today, the legacy of the Santhal Hool is commemorated in various ways, serving as a reminder of the courage and determination of the Santhal people in their fight for justice and dignity.
- **Kol Rebellion (1820-1837)**: The Kol Rebellion, also known as the Kol Uprising, occurred in 1831-1832 in the Chotanagpur plateau, involving the indigenous Kol tribes. The rebellion was a response to severe exploitation and oppression by British colonial authorities and local landlords (zamindars). The introduction of the British land revenue system disrupted traditional Kol landholding patterns, leading to land alienation and economic hardship.

The Kols, led by leaders such as Budhu Bhagat, rose in revolt against oppressive taxation, forced labor, and unfair land practices. They attacked British officials, landlords, and their estates, causing widespread unrest. The British responded with a heavy military crackdown, deploying troops to suppress the rebellion.

Although the Kol Rebellion was eventually crushed, it highlighted the exploitation faced by tribal communities and underscored the need for reforms in land and administrative policies. It remains a significant episode in the history of tribal resistance in India.
- **Rampa Rebellion (1879-1880)**: The hill tribesmen of Rampa in coastal Andhra revolted against government-supported mansabdar and restrictive forest regulations.

### **Munda Rebellion (1899-1900)**:
The Munda Rebellion, also known as the Ulgulan ("The Great Tumult"), was a significant uprising led by the Munda tribal community against British colonial rule and their allies in the late 19th century. This rebellion, primarily occurring in the Chotanagpur plateau (modern-day Jharkhand), was spearheaded by Birsa Munda, a charismatic tribal leader who sought to address the exploitation and injustices faced by his people.

 **Background and Causes**

  The Mundas experienced severe oppression from British authorities, landlords (dikus), and Christian missionaries. The British land revenue system disrupted traditional Munda landholding patterns, leading to widespread land alienation. Non-tribal landlords imposed heavy rents and forced Mundas into bonded labor, while missionaries attempted to convert them, eroding their cultural identity. This exploitation and cultural encroachment fueled growing discontent.

 **Birsa Munda: The Leader**

  Birsa Munda, born in 1875, emerged as a charismatic leader who galvanized the Munda community. Initially influenced by Christian missionaries, he later rejected their teachings and embraced his tribal roots. Birsa preached a return to traditional Munda beliefs and resistance against British and landlord exploitation. His message of reclaiming land and rejecting foreign customs resonated deeply, and he became a messianic figure for the Mundas.

 **The Rebellion**

  The Ulgulan began in the late 1890s with Birsa and his followers launching attacks against British officials, landlords, and missionaries. They targeted police stations, government offices, and landlords' properties, creating significant unrest. The British, equipped with superior military resources, responded with a massive crackdown, deploying troops to suppress the rebellion.

 **Suppression and Aftermath**

  By 1900, the rebellion was suppressed. Birsa Munda was captured and died in custody in June 1900. Despite its suppression, the rebellion highlighted the plight of tribal communities. The British introduced the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act of 1908 to protect tribal land rights, preventing further land alienation.

 **Legacy**

  The Munda Rebellion remains a significant episode in India's history of tribal resistance. Birsa Munda is celebrated as a hero and symbol of tribal identity and resistance against colonial oppression. His legacy inspires ongoing tribal movements for rights and justice, and he is commemorated through various honors in modern India.

# Chapter 3: Peasant Movements and Uprisings After 1857

#### Background and Causes
- **Colonial Exploitation**:
  - **Economic Policies**: British colonial economic policies transformed the agrarian structure, leading to the impoverishment of peasants.
  - **Land Revenue System**: The introduction of new land revenue systems, like the Zamindari and Ryotwari systems, placed heavy burdens on peasants.
  - **Ruin of Handicrafts**: The decline of handicraft industries due to British policies led to overcrowding of land as artisans were forced to turn to agriculture.

- **Impact on Peasants**:
  - **Zamindari Areas**: Peasants were subjected to rack-renting by zamindars who also demanded illegal dues and forced labor (begar).
  - **Ryotwari Areas**: Heavy land revenue was directly levied by the government, pushing peasants to borrow from moneylenders and leading to a cycle of debt and loss of land.

#### Forms of Resistance
- **Crime and Social Banditry**:
  - **Robbery and Dacoity**: Dispossessed peasants often turned to crime as a form of protest against unbearable social conditions.
  - **Elemental Protest**: This individual or small-group resistance was a desperate measure in the absence of collective action.

#### The Indigo Revolt (1859-60)
- **Background**:
  - **Indigo Cultivation**: European planters forced peasants to grow indigo, which was processed in rural factories. The system was highly oppressive and economically detrimental to cultivators.
  - **Fraudulent Contracts**: Peasants were forced into contracts that paid them far below the market price for indigo. They were also coerced into taking advances that trapped them in a cycle of forced cultivation.

- **Methods of Coercion**:
  - **Violence and Terror**: Planters used kidnapping, illegal confinement, flogging, and destruction of property to enforce compliance.
  - **Judicial Bias**: European magistrates, often socially aligned with the planters, favored them in legal matters. Few who tried to be fair were quickly transferred.

- **Revolt and Resistance**:
  - **Initial Spark**: The revolt began in Nadia district under the leadership of Digambar Biswas and Bishnu Biswas. Peasants refused to grow indigo and defended themselves against planter attacks.
  - **Spread of Revolt**: The movement spread across Bengal, with peasants refusing advances, breaking contracts, and physically resisting planter and police aggression.

- **Support and Impact**:
  - **Intelligentsia Involvement**: Bengali intellectuals, including Harish Chandra Mukherji, supported the revolt through newspaper campaigns and public meetings.
  - **Government Response**: The British government appointed a commission that exposed the abuses of the indigo system, leading to its decline in Bengal by 1860.

#### The Pabna Agrarian Unrest (1873-85)
- **Background**:
  - **Zamindar Oppression**: Efforts by zamindars to enhance rents beyond legal limits and prevent tenants from acquiring occupancy rights led to unrest.
  - **Formation of Leagues**: Peasants in Pabna district formed agrarian leagues to resist zamindar demands and organized rent strikes and legal battles.

- **Resistance Methods**:
  - **Mass Meetings**: Large crowds of peasants gathered to march through villages, intimidating zamindars and rallying support.
  - **Rent Strikes**: Peasants refused to pay enhanced rents and defended themselves against eviction attempts.

- **Government and Zamindar Response**:
  - **Legal Battles**: Peasants used legal means to fight zamindars, which led to prolonged litigation.
  - **Government Neutrality**: The government remained neutral in legal disputes but defended zamindars against violent actions. The Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885 was passed to protect tenants' rights.

- **Role of Intelligentsia**:
  - **Support for Peasants**: Indian intellectuals, including members of the Indian Association, supported the peasants' cause and campaigned for their rights.

#### The Deccan Riots (1875)
- **Background**:
  - **Ryotwari System**: In Maharashtra, Ryotwari peasants faced heavy land revenue demands, falling cotton prices after the American Civil War, and exploitation by moneylenders.
  - **Social Boycott**: Peasants initiated a social boycott of moneylenders, refusing to buy from their shops or serve them in any capacity.

- **Transition to Riots**:
  - **Violence in Supa**: The boycott escalated into riots, with peasants in Supa attacking moneylenders' houses and burning debt bonds.
  - **Spread of Riots**: The disturbances spread to other villages in Poona and Ahmednagar districts.

- **Government Response**:
  - **Repression**: The government quickly suppressed the movement, but the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act of 1879 was passed to offer some protection to peasants.

- **Role of Intelligentsia**:
  - **Support for Peasants**: The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, led by Justice Ranade, had already campaigned against the land revenue settlement, contributing to the rise of peasant protest.

#### Nature and Characteristics of Peasant Movements
- **Specific and Limited Objectives**:
  - **Economic Focus**: Movements centered on economic grievances, such as high rents, fraudulent practices by moneylenders, and eviction.
  - **Localized Struggles**: Movements were localized and lacked long-term organization or broad territorial reach.

- **Lack of Anti-Colonial Consciousness**:
  - **Limited Political Aims**: Movements did not target the colonial system itself and were not aimed at ending British rule.
  - **Absence of Unified Ideology**: Movements lacked a unified ideology or program capable of mobilizing a broader section of society.

- **Peasant Strategies**:
  - **Legal Awareness**: Peasants developed a strong awareness of their legal rights and used legal means to fight for them.
  - **Social Boycott**: Social boycott was a common tactic to isolate and pressure moneylenders and zamindars.

- **Courage and Solidarity**:
  - **Remarkable Organization**: Peasants demonstrated organizational abilities and solidarity that cut across religious and caste lines.
  - **Concessions from Colonial State**: The colonial state often granted concessions to calm down rebellions while also using force to suppress them.

#### Weaknesses and Impact
- **Lack of Long-term Organization**: Movements dissolved once their immediate objectives were achieved, leaving no lasting impact or successors.
- **Need for Modern Intelligentsia**: The absence of a modern nationalist intelligentsia and a new ideology limited the effectiveness of peasant movements.
- **Integration with National Movement**: In the 20th century, peasant discontent merged with the broader anti-imperialist struggle, leading to more effective and widespread movements.

These detailed notes provide an in-depth understanding of the key points and themes from Chapter 3, focusing on the causes, nature, and key instances of peasant movements and uprisings against British rule in India.

# Chapter 4: Foundation of the Congress: The Myth

#### Introduction to Indian National Congress
- **Establishment**: The Indian National Congress (INC) was founded in December 1885 by seventy-two political workers. It marked the first organized expression of Indian nationalism on an all-India scale.
- **Role of A.O. Hume**: A retired British ICS officer, A.O. Hume, played a significant role in the formation of the Congress.

#### The Safety Valve Theory
- **Theory Explanation**: The theory suggests that the INC was founded under the guidance and direction of Lord Dufferin, the Viceroy, to provide a safe outlet for the rising discontent among the masses, preventing a violent revolution.
- **Myth Popularity**: This theory has been widely accepted and propagated by various political groups to either criticize or defend the Congress's origins and its subsequent actions.

#### Criticism and Propagation of the Theory
- **Lala Lajpat Rai**: In his 1916 work "Young India," Lala Lajpat Rai used the safety-valve theory to criticize the Moderates in the Congress, suggesting that the INC was more interested in preserving British rule than achieving political liberty for India.
- **R. Palme Dutt**: In "India Today" (1939), Dutt emphasized the theory, arguing that the Congress was created by the British to forestall an impending revolution. He claimed the Congress had a dual character: collaborating with imperialism while leading the masses in the national struggle.
- **M.S. Golwalkar**: In his pamphlet "We" (1939), Golwalkar used the theory to attack the Congress for its secularism, arguing that it had led Hindus to denationalization.

#### The Alleged Secret Reports
- **Seven Volumes of Secret Reports**: Hume claimed to have read seven volumes of secret reports in Simla in 1878, which convinced him of a vast conspiracy among the lower classes to overthrow British rule.
- **Transformation of the Reports**: Over time, these reports were transformed in various accounts into official government documents, CID reports, or secret police reports.

#### Analysis of the Safety Valve Theory
- **Hume's Position**: In 1878, Hume was the Secretary to the Department of Revenue, Agriculture, and Commerce, not the Home Department, which would have access to intelligence reports.
- **Evidence in Wedderburn’s Book**: Sir William Wedderburn's biography of Hume provides critical insights into the origins of the safety-valve theory. Hume's information was derived from religious leaders (Gurus and Chelas) rather than official government reports.

#### The Role of Gurus and Chelas
- **Religious Influence**: Hume was influenced by religious leaders who provided information through their network of disciples (Chelas).
- **Occult Powers**: Hume believed these Gurus and Chelas had supernatural powers and could gather information and influence events from afar.

#### Connection to Theosophy
- **Madame Blavatsky**: Hume was influenced by Madame Blavatsky, a prominent Theosophist who claimed to be in contact with Mahatmas (spiritual masters).
- **Mahatmas' Role**: These Mahatmas, according to Hume, gathered secret information on Indian affairs and had previously saved the British Empire during the 1857 revolt.

#### Dufferin’s Position
- **Initial Support**: Dufferin initially expressed agreement with Hume’s concerns about social reform but did not support the Congress’s political objectives.
- **Subsequent Opposition**: Dufferin and other British officials soon grew wary of the Congress, viewing it as a potential threat to British rule.

#### Conclusion
- **Debunking the Myth**: Historical evidence, including Dufferin’s private papers and Hume’s letters, suggests that the safety-valve theory is a myth. The INC was not a creation of the British government but rather a genuine effort by Indian leaders to organize and articulate nationalist aspirations.
- **Congress’s Evolution**: Despite its contentious origins, the INC evolved into a significant nationalist movement, leading mass protests and campaigns for India’s independence.

These detailed notes provide an in-depth understanding of the key points and themes from Chapter 4, focusing on the founding of the Indian National Congress and the myths surrounding its origins.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Foundation of the Indian National Congress: The Reality

#### Introduction
- **Clearing the Myths**: The previous chapter debunked the myth of the Indian National Congress (INC) as a 'safety valve' created by the British to prevent a violent revolution. This chapter focuses on the real reasons and processes behind the founding of the INC.

#### Political Awakening Before 1885
- **Gradual Process**: The founding of the INC in 1885 was not sudden. It was the culmination of political awakening that began in the 1860s and 1870s.
- **Role of Modern Intellectuals**: By the late 1870s and early 1880s, modern intellectuals in India, who saw themselves as representatives of national interests, played a crucial role in this political awakening.

#### Early Political Activities and Organizations
- **New Associations**: Younger, more radical nationalists established new political associations due to the limitations and narrow focus of older organizations.
  - **Indian Association (1876)**: Founded by Surendranath Banerjea and Anand Mohan Bose in Bengal.
  - **Madras Mahajan Sabha (1884)**: Formed by M. Viraraghavachariar, G. Subramaniya Iyer, P. Ananda Charlu, and others in Madras.
  - **Bombay Presidency Association (1885)**: Formed by K.T. Telang and Pherozeshah Mehta, breaking away from older leaders.

#### Major Nationalist Newspapers
- **Role of the Press**: The formation of major nationalist newspapers such as The Hindu, Tribune, Bengalee, and Kesari played a significant role in spreading nationalist ideas and mobilizing public opinion.

#### Political Developments Leading to the INC
- **Need for All-India Organization**: By 1885, the necessity for an all-India political organization was widely recognized among nationalists.
- **Political Agitations**: Various political agitations in the preceding years laid the groundwork for the INC:
  - **Cotton Import Duties Campaign (1875-1885)**: Aimed at protecting the Indian textile industry.
  - **Campaign for Indianization of Services (1877-1888)**: Advocated for more Indians in government services.
  - **Opposition to Vernacular Press Act (1878)**: Fought against government control over the Indian press.
  - **Protest Against Arms Act (1878)**: Opposed efforts to disarm Indians.
  - **Support for Ilbert Bill (1883)**: Aimed at allowing Indian judges to try Europeans.

#### The Founding of the INC
- **Culmination of Political Work**: The founding of the INC was a natural culmination of years of political work. It was seen as a necessary step to achieve the objectives of the nationalist movement.
- **First Session**: The first session of the INC was held in Bombay on December 28, 1885. The participants aimed to promote national unity and develop a common political platform.

#### Objectives of the INC
1. **Promotion of National Unity**:
  - **India as a Nation**: The primary objective was to promote the idea of India as a nation and foster a sense of national unity among Indians.
  - **Congress Sessions**: To reach all regions, Congress sessions were rotated among different parts of the country, and efforts were made to include representatives from all religious and regional backgrounds.  For example, In the 1888 session, a rule was established to address the concerns of religious minorities by ensuring that no resolution would be passed if it faced strong opposition from an overwhelming majority of Hindu or Muslim delegates. In 1889, a minority clause was introduced in the resolution demanding the reform of legislative councils. This clause ensured that minority groups, such as Parsis, Christians, Muslims, or Hindus, would have representation in the councils proportional to their population. The rationale was that India, being a diverse and non-homogeneous country, required different political methods compared to Europe.

2. **Common Political Platform**:
  - **Political Education and Mobilization**: The INC aimed to create a common political platform around which political workers could gather and conduct activities to educate and mobilize the people on an all-India basis.
  - **Exclusion of Social Reform**: The INC decided not to take up social reform issues, focusing instead on political grievances and rights.

3. **Formation of National Leadership**:
  - **Unity Among Leaders**: The INC sought to create a unified national leadership that could guide the nationalist movement effectively.
  - **Democratic Practices**: The INC was organized democratically, with proceedings conducted through debate and discussion, and decisions made by voting.

4. **Development of Anti-Colonial Ideology**:
  - **Understanding Colonialism**: The early nationalist leaders aimed to develop a clear understanding of colonialism and formulate an anti-colonial ideology based on this understanding.
  - **Struggle About Colonialism**: The initial struggle was not just against colonialism but also about understanding and articulating the nature of colonial rule.

#### Role of A.O. Hume
- **Hume’s Contribution**: A.O. Hume, a retired British ICS officer, played a key role in organizing the INC. His involvement helped to mitigate official hostility towards the nascent organization.
- **Hume as a Lightning Conductor**: The nationalist leaders saw Hume as a 'lightning conductor' who could attract and deflect the initial suspicions and hostilities of the colonial authorities.

#### Conclusion
- **Success of Early National Movement**: The early nationalist leaders laid the foundations for a secular and democratic national movement. Their efforts in political education, the formation of an all-India leadership, and the development of an anti-colonial ideology were significant achievements.
- **Legacy**: The work of the early nationalists set the stage for the growth of the INC into a mass movement in the 20th century, leading to India’s eventual independence.

These detailed notes provide an in-depth understanding of the key points and themes from Chapter 5, focusing on the real factors and processes behind the founding of the Indian National Congress.

# Chapter 7: An Economic Critique of Colonialism

#### Introduction
- **Foundation of Economic Critique**: The Indian national movement was deeply rooted in an understanding of colonial economic exploitation. The early leaders, known as Moderates, developed a significant economic critique of colonialism in the 19th century.

#### Early Indian Perception of British Rule
- **Initial Positivity**: Early Indian intellectuals had a positive attitude towards British rule, hoping it would modernize India and develop its productive forces.
- **Gradual Disillusionment**: By 1860, the reality of British rule led to disillusionment as Indians noticed regression and underdevelopment, prompting a deeper analysis of British rule.

#### Key Figures in Economic Critique
- **Dadabhai Naoroji**: Known as the Grand Old Man of India, he spent his life analyzing and criticizing British economic policies. He highlighted the continuous impoverishment of India due to colonial exploitation.
- **Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade**: Educated a generation on the value of modern industrial development.
- **Romesh Chandra Dutt**: Published "The Economic History of India," examining colonial rule's economic impact in detail.

#### Main Themes of Economic Critique
- **Colonial Structure**: The early nationalists identified three aspects of colonial domination: trade, industry, and finance.
- **Trade and Industry**: They argued that colonialism transformed India into a supplier of raw materials and a market for British goods, stifling local industries.
- **Finance**: Foreign capital investment was seen as exploitative rather than developmental, leading to the drain of Indian wealth.

#### Economic Agitation and Analysis
- **Poverty and Impoverishment**: The nationalists asserted that India's increasing poverty was a result of colonial policies, not natural causes. They focused on economic development through industrialization.
- **Indian Capital vs. Foreign Capital**: They emphasized the need for industrialization based on Indian capital, rejecting foreign investment as exploitative.

#### Decline of Traditional Industries
- **Destruction of Handicrafts**: The deliberate policy to stamp out Indian industries in favor of British manufacturers led to the ruin of traditional handicrafts.
- **Critique of Railways and Trade**: Nationalists argued that railways and foreign trade, while appearing beneficial, actually facilitated the economic exploitation of India by British interests.

#### The Drain Theory
- **Concept**: Proposed by Dadabhai Naoroji, it highlighted the transfer of Indian wealth to Britain without any economic return to India. This drain included salaries, pensions, profits, and Home Charges.
- **Economic Impact**: The drain theory explained the fundamental cause of India's poverty and the exploitative nature of British rule.
- **Political Significance**: The drain theory was easily understood and widely accepted, helping to unify different sections of Indian society against colonial rule.

#### Undermining Colonial Hegemony
- **Loss of Moral Legitimacy**: The economic critique undermined the ideological hegemony of British rule by exposing its exploitative nature. This gradually eroded the moral foundation of colonial rule in the minds of Indians.
- **Shift in Political Demands**: Initially, nationalists demanded a share in political power. By 1905, leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji were calling for self-government or Swaraj, recognizing that true economic development required political control.

#### Legacy of Economic Critique
- **Foundation for National Movement**: The early economic critique laid the groundwork for the national movement. It provided a scientific analysis of colonial exploitation, which later nationalists built upon.
- **Inspiration for Mass Movements**: The themes developed by early nationalists were popularized in the 20th century, fueling mass agitations and movements under leaders like Mahatma Gandhi.

These detailed notes provide an in-depth understanding of the key points and themes from Chapter 7, focusing on the economic critique of colonialism and its significance in the Indian national movement.

# Chapter 8: The Fight to Secure Press Freedom

#### Introduction
- **Role of Press**: The press played a crucial role in arousing political consciousness, inculcating nationalism, and exposing colonial rule.
- **Challenges**: The press faced significant legal restrictions, including Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, which punished attempts to excite feelings of disaffection towards the government.

#### Strategies Adopted by Indian Journalists
- **Prefacing Loyalty**: Journalists often prefaced their writings with expressions of loyalty to avoid prosecution.
- **Using British Sources**: Anti-imperialist extracts from British socialist and Irish newspapers were published, making it difficult for the government to prosecute without targeting British citizens.
- **Irony and Sarcasm**: Writers like B.G. Tilak and Motilal Ghosh used irony, sarcasm, and mock-seriousness to criticize the government subtly.
- **Combining Simplicity with Subtlety**: Nationalist journalists aimed to educate a semi-literate public while avoiding legal repercussions. This required a balance of simplicity and subtlety in their writing.

#### Major Incidents and Laws
- **Vernacular Press Act (1878)**: Aimed at suppressing Indian language newspapers, it allowed for the confiscation of printing presses and materials. The act was opposed by Indian nationalists and was eventually repealed in 1881 by Lord Ripon.
- **Amrita Bazar Patrika Incident**: The newspaper converted overnight from a bilingual to an English-only publication to avoid the Vernacular Press Act.
- **Curzon’s Convocation Address Incident**: Lord Curzon's claim that truth was a Western concept was mocked by the Amrita Bazar Patrika, exposing his hypocrisy and causing widespread amusement in Bengal.

#### Key Figures and Contributions
- **Bal Gangadhar Tilak**: A prominent nationalist leader and journalist, Tilak used his newspaper, Kesari, to criticize British policies. He faced multiple prosecutions and became a symbol of the fight for press freedom.
- **Widespread Protests**: Tilak’s imprisonments led to nationwide protests and strikes, highlighting the importance of press freedom in the national struggle.

#### Legislation and Repression
- **Section 124A and 153A**: In 1898, Section 124A was amended, and Section 153A was added to the penal code to further restrict the press and punish attempts to incite hatred against the government.
- **Swadeshi and Boycott Movement**: The movement led to increased repression, with fresh laws enacted to control the press and prosecute editors and journalists.

#### Tilak’s Trials and Impact
- **First Trial (1897)**: Tilak was tried and sentenced for sedition. His imprisonment led to widespread protests and enhanced his status as a national leader.
- **Second Trial (1908)**: Following his articles on terrorism and government repression, Tilak was again tried for sedition and sentenced to six years’ transportation. His trial and subsequent imprisonment in Mandalay further galvanized public support and resistance against colonial rule.
- **Legacy and Influence**: Tilak’s trials underscored the importance of press freedom and inspired future leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi’s own trial for sedition in 1922 mirrored Tilak’s experiences, demonstrating the continued struggle for press freedom.

#### Conclusion
- **Press as a Tool for National Awakening**: The press was integral to the national movement, serving as a tool for political education, mobilization, and resistance against colonial rule.
- **Enduring Legacy**: The fight for press freedom laid a strong foundation for the broader struggle for independence, highlighting the critical role of journalism in challenging colonial power and advocating for self-governance.
