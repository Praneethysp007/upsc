# Functions of an Ecosystem

**Main Functions:**
1. **Energy Flow** - The transfer of energy through different trophic levels within the ecosystem. It begins with producers and flows through various consumers and decomposers.
2. **Nutrient Cycling (Biogeochemical Cycles)** - The circulation and transformation of nutrients through the living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components of the ecosystem. Important cycles include the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles.
3. **Ecological Succession** - The process by which the structure of a biological community evolves over time. It involves stages of species colonization and replacement until a stable climax community is reached.

### Energy Flow

**Trophic Levels:**
1. **Producers (Autotrophs)** - Organisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Examples include green plants and algae.
2. **Primary Consumers (Herbivores)** - Organisms that feed on producers. Examples include cows, rabbits, and caterpillars.
3. **Secondary Consumers (Carnivores)** - Organisms that feed on primary consumers. Examples include snakes and frogs.
4. **Tertiary Consumers** - Organisms that feed on secondary consumers. Examples include eagles and big fish.
5. **Quaternary Consumers (Top Carnivores)** - Apex predators that have no natural predators. Examples include lions and sharks.

**Key Points:**
- **Unidirectional Flow:** Energy flows in one direction from producers to various levels of consumers and is not recycled.
- **Energy Loss:** At each trophic level, energy is lost as heat due to metabolic processes. This loss limits the number of trophic levels.
- **Efficiency:** Only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next level, known as the 10% law.

### Food Chains and Food Webs

**Food Chain:**
- A linear sequence of organisms where each organism is eaten by the next one in the chain.
- **Example:** Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Hawk

**Types of Food Chains:**
1. **Grazing Food Chain:**
   - Starts with living green plants and moves through herbivores to carnivores.
   - **Terrestrial Example:** Grass → Caterpillar → Lizard → Snake
   - **Aquatic Example:** Phytoplankton → Zooplankton → Fish → Pelican
2. **Detritus Food Chain:**
   - Begins with dead organic matter and moves through decomposers and detritivores to higher-level predators.
   - **Example:** Dead leaves → Earthworms → Chicken → Hawk

**Food Web:**
- A complex network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem.
- **Interconnected Chains:** Provides multiple pathways for energy flow, increasing stability and resilience.
- **Example:** In a grassland, grass can be eaten by rabbits, grasshoppers, goats, or cows, and these herbivores can be prey for multiple predators.

### Ecological Pyramids

**Types of Pyramids:**
1. **Pyramid of Numbers:**
   - Illustrates the number of individual organisms at each trophic level.
   - **Upright Pyramid:** Common in grasslands, where the number of producers (grasses) is very high compared to consumers (grasshoppers, rats, snakes, hawks).
   - **Inverted Pyramid:** Common in forests, where few large producers (trees) support many herbivores (birds) and even more parasites and hyperparasites.

2. **Pyramid of Biomass:**
   - Represents the total biomass (dry weight) of all organisms at each trophic level.
   - **Upright Pyramid:** Common in terrestrial ecosystems where biomass decreases from producers to top carnivores.
   - **Inverted Pyramid:** Seen in aquatic ecosystems where small, rapidly reproducing producers (phytoplankton) support larger consumers (zooplankton, fish).

3. **Pyramid of Energy:**
   - Illustrates the flow of energy through each trophic level.
   - **Always Upright:** Energy decreases at each trophic level due to loss as heat, reflecting the laws of thermodynamics.
   - **Example:** If an ecosystem receives 1000 kcal of solar energy, only 100 kcal is stored in plants, 10 kcal in herbivores, and 1 kcal in carnivores.

### Pollutants and Trophic Levels

**Processes:**
1. **Bioaccumulation:**
   - Refers to the accumulation of pollutants in an organism from the environment.
   - **Example:** Pesticides accumulating in the tissues of a plant.

2. **Biomagnification:**
   - Refers to the increase in concentration of pollutants at each successive trophic level.
   - **Example:** Mercury accumulating in fish, with higher concentrations in larger predatory fish.

**Nondegradable Pollutants:**
- Pollutants that cannot be broken down by living organisms and hence persist in the environment, such as DDT and PCBs.
- These pollutants can cause serious health issues as they accumulate in the food chain.

### Biotic Interactions

**Types of Interactions:**
1. **Mutualism:** Both species benefit.
   - **Example:** Bees pollinating flowers while obtaining nectar.
2. **Commensalism:** One species benefits, the other is unaffected.
   - **Example:** Barnacles on whales, where barnacles get transportation and access to plankton.
3. **Competition:** Both species are harmed by the interaction.
   - **Example:** Two predators competing for the same prey.
4. **Predation:** One species benefits (predator), the other is harmed (prey).
   - **Example:** A lion hunting a zebra.
5. **Parasitism:** One species benefits (parasite), the other is harmed (host).
   - **Example:** Ticks feeding on a deer.
6. **Amensalism:** One species is harmed, the other is unaffected.
   - **Example:** A large tree shading smaller plants.
7. **Neutralism:** Neither species benefits or is harmed.
   - **Example:** Two species coexisting in the same habitat without affecting each other.

### Biogeochemical Cycles

**Types of Cycles:**
1. **Gaseous Cycles:**
   - **Water Cycle (Hydrologic):**
     - Continuous movement of water through evaporation, transpiration, condensation, and precipitation.
     - Important for nutrient transportation and as a solvent for biochemical reactions.
   - **Carbon Cycle:**
     - Involves the movement of carbon through photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and combustion.
     - Short-term cycle includes photosynthesis and respiration.
     - Long-term cycle involves carbon storage in fossil fuels and sedimentary rocks.
   - **Nitrogen Cycle:**
     - Conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into usable forms (ammonia, nitrates) through nitrogen fixation.
     - Nitrogen is essential for the synthesis of amino acids and proteins.

2. **Sedimentary Cycles:**
   - **Phosphorus Cycle:**
     - Phosphorus moves from rocks to soil and water bodies through weathering and erosion.
     - Essential for DNA, RNA, and ATP.
   - **Sulfur Cycle:**
     - Sulfur moves from rocks and sediments to the atmosphere through weathering, volcanic activity, and decomposition.
     - Essential for amino acids and proteins.

**Interconnected Cycles:**
- Nutrient cycles interact with each other and are crucial for maintaining ecosystem balance and supporting life.

### Ecological Succession

**Types of Succession:**
1. **Primary Succession:**
   - Occurs on newly formed habitats without soil, such as volcanic lava or glacial retreat areas.
   - **Pioneer Species:** First organisms to colonize, such as lichens and mosses.
   - **Soil Formation:** Pioneer species break down rocks, accumulating organic matter to form soil.
   - **Community Development:** Gradual replacement of pioneer species by more complex plant and animal communities until a stable climax community is established.

2. **Secondary Succession:**
   - Occurs in areas where a climax community has been disturbed but soil remains, such as after a forest fire or agricultural abandonment.
   - **Stages:** Rapid colonization by pioneer species, followed by intermediate species, and finally the return of a stable climax community.

**Characteristics:**
- **Increased Productivity:** More biomass production as succession progresses.
- **Nutrient Shift:** Movement of nutrients from non-living to living components.
- **Increased Diversity:** More species and niches develop, enhancing ecosystem complexity.
- **Complex Food Webs:** More interactions among species, leading to a stable and resilient ecosystem.
